<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Mortgage?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mortgage is a long-term loan provided by banks and other financial institutions, where the property serves as loan collateral. Simply put, when you obtain a mortgage to buy a house, the property acts as collateral until the loan is fully repaid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mortgage loans differ from other types of credit because they tend to have lower interest rates and longer repayment terms due to the security provided by the real estate collateral. However, this also means that the approval process tends to be more rigorous, requiring a thorough evaluation of your personal finances.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Requirements for Obtaining a Mortgage</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Securing a mortgage involves meeting various requirements set by financial institutions, ensuring the loan benefits both parties — the borrower and lender alike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li><strong>Good Credit History: </strong>Your credit score is key. Most lenders look for FICO scores of at least 620 for conventional mortgages, though FHA loans may allow lower scores. A strong credit history can also help secure better interest rates.</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> For many conventional mortgages, a 20% down payment is required. However, government-backed loans (FHA, VA, USDA) may require as little as 3% to 5%.</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li><strong>Stable Income: </strong>table Income: Lenders verify income and employment to ensure you can meet long-term mortgage payments. If you’re working on improving your financial standing before applying, tools like <a href="https://us.topfinanzas.com/financial-solutions/discover-personal-loans-benefits/">Discover Personal Loans</a> can offer structured financing options for consolidating debt or covering unexpected expenses, helping to strengthen your financial profile.</li>
    <!-- /wp:list-item -->

    <!-- wp:list-item -->
    <li><strong>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: </strong>Most lenders prefer a DTI (the percentage of your income allocated to debt) of no more than 43%, though some may allow a higher DTI depending on other factors. Meeting these requirements not only helps you qualify for a mortgage but positions you for better terms and conditions, which are crucial for long-term financial health.</li>
